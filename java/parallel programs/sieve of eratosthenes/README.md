# Sieve of Eratosthenes and Factorization

This program uses an ancient algorithm called the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to a given a number N <br/> and uses it to factorize the 100 numbers under N*N.

## Usage: 

The program requires that the user enters 3 inputs. 

* ``` N ``` is the number. (Must be greater than 16)
* ``` k ``` is the amount of threads. (Entering 0 will utilize all the cores in user's computer)
* ``` runs ``` is the amount of times you want the program to run. (This is for finding the median runtime) 

### How to run:

```
javac *.java && java Main {N} {k} {runs}
```
